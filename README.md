=============

## CUDA based simulation codes for magnetic models and cellular automatons

These codes provide an efficient and simple laboratory using Thrust and CuRand CUDA packages

Implemented models:

- bimodal ferromagnet, antiferomagnet and spinglass
- spinglass-like cellular automaton
- potts model (planned)
- life-game cellular automaton (planned)
- seggregation model

Simulation methods:

- Monte Carlo dinamics
- Efficient energy calculation
- Phase space scanning

Implemented interaction topologies:

- 2D triangular grid  (6 nearest neighbors)
- 2D rectangular grid (4 nn)
- 2D hexagonal grid   (3 nn)
- 3D diamond grid     (4 nn)
- 3D cubic grid       (6 nn)
